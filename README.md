# algorithm_A_star
Algorithm A star (A*) for finding the shortest path in a graph in Python

This code implements the search for the shortest path in a graph using the A star (A*) method.
The starting point, target point and a list of all points (objects of the cell class) are specified.
Keep in mind that this is a Cartesian coordinate system. Therefore, each vertex of the graph is designated by x and y coordinates.
You can also add obstacles to the algorithm by passing obstacle objects to the obstacles list.
